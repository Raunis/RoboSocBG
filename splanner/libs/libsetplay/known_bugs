- role and parameter names must be different, not simply by an ending number. E.g., 'player' and 'player2' will not be parsed (MAYBE SOLVED?!? I THINK SO...)

- order of players in setplay header and steps must be the same. Must correct this.

- deletion of currentSetplay in SetplayManager::processReceivedMessage was crashing and was therefore disabled.
